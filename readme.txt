Opposites Subtract

By: Nate Mills

Created for the 2021 Yogscast Jingle Jam Game Jam.
Jam Theme: Opposites


"A super simple puzzle game where you push opposite blocks together to find the exit for each level."


Controls:
WASD or Arrow keys: Move the "you" block.
R: Reloads the current level
ESC: Opens pause menu

My first game jam, with my first actual (not just following a tutorial) game.
